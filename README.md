CalculFacile: A Simple Mathematical Toolkit

This project, "CalculFacile", is a web-based application that serves as a simple toolkit for performing essential mathematical operations. It provides the following functionalities:

Features:
1. Matrix Operations: Perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication on 2x2 matrices with an intuitive interface. Results are displayed in a clean, matrix-style format.
2. Quadratic Equation Solver: Easily solve quadratic equations and view the roots (real solutions only).
3. Basic Calculator: A functional calculator for performing arithmetic operations with keyboard and button support.

Technologies Used:
- HTML/CSS: For creating the structure and styling of the interface.
- JavaScript: For implementing the logic and interactivity of the tools.
- Responsive Design: The interface is user-friendly and visually appealing.
